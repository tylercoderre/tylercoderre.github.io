          <h3>THE MARK</h3>
          <p>The mark for Person Centered Services combines elements of the upstreatched arms of a hopeful / joyful person along with a flourishing tree of life. The blue and green color combination was inspired from their orriginal branding to tie the two together. Along with refreshing the green and blue, the goal was also to introduce various complimentary accent colors that can pair well with the new mark.</p>

          <h3>BRAND GRADIENTS</h3>
          <p>To add some vibrancy and life to the brand that can be used in a variety of applications, two gradient swatches were designed combining the two primary colors of the mark and two of the new secondary brand colors. These are used for solid backgrounds, accents, and overlays to brighten up the work and subject matter.</p>

          <h3>LOGO RESPONSIVE</h3>
          <p>When designing the logo it was intended from the start to bbe adaptable to various sizes and applications. Going from top to bottom we start with the full logo with tagline. This is used primarily in large applications and signage. Secondly is the primary full mark which will bbe used in the majority of applications. Thirdly, is the logo mark itself. This is intended for smaller applications or use scenarios where the brand name is already estalished. Therefore the mark will show up in social media profile photos, accents of print pieces, and small applications in the print and digital spaces. Lastly, there is a distilled mark to it's bare essence of the outstreatched arms. This is for only for use cases of extreme tiny-ness, i.e. the site's favicon.</p>

          <p>Upon completion of the of the brand, one of the deliverables I provided is a detailed brand guide which provides logo usage, logo responsive breakdowns, color swatches and their codes, and the brand's typography.</p>

          <h3>BUSINESS CARDS</h3>
          <p>During their transition, Person Centered Services had a couple use cases they need to address that one business card wouldn't bbbe able to clearly articulate. To solve for this there are three business card designs that can be used. The first, is the general staff card which contains all of that employee's necessary contact information. Secondly, is their general contact card. These were designed to bbe printed en masse to be haded out with collateral, at events, and so on for general awareness purposes. Lastly, the third card was designed to be filled in by newly transitioning care coordinators. Since these coordinators were located throughout the organizations's service area and the transition was a swift one, this was a way to get branded materials in their hands quickly.</p>

          <h3>FOLDER TOOL KIT</h3>
          <p>To help address all the questions to the families reciving care that would now be falling under this new organization, a comprehensive folder tool kit was developed to help answer many of those questions. Included in the packet was information regarding to what the transition entailled, a set of frequently asked questions, general information about Person Centered Services, and a post card that can be filled out to indicate if they were going to continue with or opt-out of Person Centered Services after the transition.</p>

          <p>To be a hub for questions and information a website was created for Person centered Services.
